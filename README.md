# evertils-log-helper

Previously, my most commonly used tools were written in [bash](https://gist.github.com/aapis/ebf36e040ea4f787c109931f9978d0ef) and were a pain to migrate to a new system.  Now you simply install them from cargo.

## Install

`cargo install evertils-log-helper`

## Dependencies

As this just wraps the [evertils](https://github.com/aapis/evertils) package, you need that.
